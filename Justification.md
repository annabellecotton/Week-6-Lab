**Justification for the Week-6-Lab licensing and code of conduct

This program runs on two pre-existing documents: the Apache License and the Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct. To create a well rounded program, these documents were chosen to fit our open source program best.

**LICENSING

Compared with many other licesing programs researched, the Apache License was most beneficial and relevant to the program.
The license contains:

- A non-exclusive, no-charge, and royalty-free copyright and patent license. An essential for open source.

- A redistrubition license that requires extensive credit to the authors. This is important as young programmers in the field on Computer Science can feel safe knowing that their work must be creditted to their name.

- It also highlights that the program's trademarks are not include. This was important to us as we can secure our and our program's, names and likeness.

**CODE OF CONDUCT

The Contributor Covenant Code of Coduct was chosen for it's popularity and familiarity in the industry. As many CoCs are alike, there were less things to differentiate this CoC. However, as it is the most widespread CoC, used by Firefox, Google, Microsoft, Linux, and more, we thought using it would help our reliablity and match with many other top programs in the computer science world.
